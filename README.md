<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Project created in order to learn new technologies: Django, Bootstrap, SQLite, JavaScript. The idea of project is close to my heart: eco-friendly, cheap and fun - second hand clothing.

## Functionality Of The Project:

### Looking Through Items
Items are added by admin user in conventional Django admin page. User can scroll through items and view details about them.
Details will diverge from one another because of item category e.g. if the item belongs to category 'shoes' it will show shoe size instead of clothing size.
